Notes so that I can build the windows executable again, was a tedious process
You need to download wget, a recent version so that you can SSL connect to github archive for
the stencilia dependency. I used wget 1.19.4 'https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/'
to make it easier you will need a few linux utility commands. I stole mine from Casal2
One that was a pain in the ass was find() is different between windows and linux. So I got
a linux find.exe changed it to find_linux which should be in a folder in this directory.
other utilities you will need, many of these will be in Rtools as well, so that may be useful to install
	-sed
	-uname
	-rm
	-unzip
	-tar
	-mv
	-You will want R installed.
	-touch
	
Building Boost.
I had trouble with the 'project-config.jam' file this should get modified during the bootstrap.bat call
but wasn't for me blah... just double check that it looks like below, otherwise it will build all the libraries
many of them will fail which will give you the impression everything failed but that is not the case.
so if you have this format it will only build the two libraries we wont (fingers cross with no errors)

`````````````````````````````````````````````
import option ; 
import feature ;

using gcc ; 

project : default-build <toolset>gcc ; 

libraries = --with-filesystem --with-test --with-random ;

option.set keep-going : false ; 
 
option.set libdir : /lib ;
``````````````````````````````````````````````

you may need to change verions of the boost library
linux you can be loose and write the g++ call -lboost_system  but on windows you need be more explicit e.g.
-lboost_system-mgw51-mt-1_62 and so depending on boost version and compiler this may change


And then the rest should be good to go also
